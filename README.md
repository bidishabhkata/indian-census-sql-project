#  Indian Census Data Analysis (SQL Project)

##  Project Goal
To explore, analyze, and derive demographic insights from Indian Census data using SQL. The objective was to apply real-world SQL skills to answer business-relevant and socially impactful questions based on population, literacy, gender distribution, and growth patterns.

##  Tools Used
- MySQL (Workbench)
- Excel (for initial data formatting and CSV conversion)

---

##  Key Findings
- âœ… **Total population of India** calculated using district-level data
- âœ… **Top 3 states** by literacy rate and **bottom 3 states** by sex ratio identified
- âœ… Computed **male and female population** from total population using sex ratio
- âœ… Estimated **previous census population** using growth rates
- âœ… Analyzed **state-wise literacy and illiteracy levels**
- âœ… Explored **population vs. area ratios** to estimate population density over time
- âœ… Used advanced SQL: CTEs, window functions, joins, aggregations, and formatting
